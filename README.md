# Data Visualization (CSC_51052_EP) - 2024/2025

## Course Overview

This repository contains materials and resources for the course **CSC_51052_EP: Data Visualization**, part of the **Computer Science** curriculum. The course emphasizes the role of data visualization in leveraging the human visual system to facilitate perception and cognition, enabling users to explore, analyze, and communicate data insights. The course covers key visualization techniques for different data structures, including multivariate data, hierarchical structures, networks, time series, and geographic data.

### Key Topics:

- Fundamentals of Visual Perception: How human visual perception informs the design of effective visualizations.
- Visualization Techniques: Methods for visualizing multivariate data, hierarchical structures, networks, time series, and geographical data.
- Interactive Data Exploration: Enabling users to interact with visualizations for detailed insights and exploration.
- Web-Based Visualization: Using web technologies, including D3.js and Vega-Lite, to create interactive, platform-independent visualizations.

## Prerequisites

While experience with web development (JavaScript) is a plus, it is not a strict requirement for the course.

## Course Structure

- Total Hours: 36 hours of in-person sessions, including lectures and practical exercises.
- Credits: 5 ECTS
- Evaluation: 
  - Students are evaluated based on their project work (individual or group) and lab assignments. 
  - Projects involve developing interactive visualizations using web technologies such as D3.js and Vega-Lite.
  - Lab sessions focus on technical skills related to D3.js and Vega-Lite, with a final open-ended lab to explore more advanced topics.

## Instructor

- Professor Emmanuel Pietriga

## Installation and Setup

For practical exercises, you will be using Visual Studio Code (or its open-source counterpart Visual Studio Codium), along with the Live Server extension for running a local development server. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

1. Install Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio Codium:
   Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio Codium](https://vscodium.com/).
2. Install the Live Server Extension:
   In Visual Studio Code/Codium, go to the Extensions view (press `Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for Live Server, and install it.
3. Install D3.js and Vega-Lite:
   You can use a CDN to load D3.js and Vega-Lite directly into your HTML projects. Add the following lines inside your HTML `<head>` section:
   ```html
   <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5.21.0"></script>
   ```
4. Launch the Live Server:
   After setting up your HTML and JavaScript files, right-click on your HTML file in Visual Studio Code/Codium and select **Open with Live Server**. This will launch a local development server to view your project in the browser.

This setup will allow you to create and run interactive web-based visualizations using D3.js and Vega-Lite in Visual Studio Code/Codium.
