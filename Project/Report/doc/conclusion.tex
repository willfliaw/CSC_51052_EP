\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{chap:conclusion}

In this work, we have created multiple plots to analyze Olympic Games data and uncover deeply embedded patterns within it. These visualizations have allowed us to derive new insights about the Olympics from both geographical and social perspectives.

In future work, Olympic Games data can be analyzed from political and economic perspectives. By integrating this data with economic indicators such as the GINI index(a measure of income inequality within a country) and GDP(Gross Domestic Product), it would be possible to gain deeper insights into how economic conditions and political factors influence participation, performance, and trends in the Olympics.
