\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}

The Olympic Games serve as a remarkable global stage where athletes from various countries compete, showcasing their skills while embodying the cultural and historical narratives of their nations. Over more than a century, the Games have generated a rich repository of data that reflects the evolution of athletic participation, medal distributions, and international representation.

This project leverages advanced data visualization techniques to explore trends and patterns in the Olympic Games from 1986 to 2022. The focus is on uncovering insights into athlete migration and medal performance, using datasets sourced primarily from the Kaggle-hosted Olympic Games Medals 1986-2022 repository \cite{olympic_19862022}. Through interactive visualizations created with tools like D3.js \cite{d3}, we aim to provide an intuitive understanding of the relationships and dynamics underpinning Olympic performance over time.

The following sections outline the dataset, the methodologies employed for data preparation and analysis, and the results derived from the visualizations. %This report emphasizes the role of data visualization in interpreting complex datasets and uncovering meaningful historical and competitive trends.
