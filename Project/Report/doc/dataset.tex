\chapter{Dataset Overview} \label{chap:dataset}

This project relies on the \textit{Olympic Games Medals 1986-2022} dataset, sourced from Kaggle \cite{olympic_19862022}. This dataset was originally scraped from the official International Olympic Committee website \cite{olympics}, ensuring its alignment with authoritative data sources. It consists of multiple files, each providing specific details about athletes, medal outcomes, event results, and hosting nations. Key files include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{olympic\_athletes.csv}: Details about athletes, including demographics and participation history.
    \item \texttt{olympic\_medals.csv}: Records of medals awarded across events and disciplines.
    \item \texttt{olympic\_hosts.csv}: Information about hosting cities, countries, and the duration of each Olympic event.
    \item \texttt{olympic\_results.csv}: Comprehensive details on event results, including participants and rankings.
\end{itemize}

A full description of the dataset can be found in Appendix \ref{app:A}.
